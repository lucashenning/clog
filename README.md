# c.Log
c.Log is the result of my master thesis at the university of Hamburg and delivers a new approach of privacy compliant log handling.

### What does c.Log do?
c.Log is a centralized log application in compliance with German security and privacy restrictions. It provides a new approach of data deletion and decays log information exponentially.
